# data-migration project
* * *

This is a Visual Studio project to migrate an existing university student system to a new platform using C++.  It contains all the necessary code files and folder structure to compile.

The program will maintain a current roster of students within a given degree type. Student data for the program includes student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete each course, and degree type.  
It will read a list of students stored in csv format and use function calls to manipulate data into a table. 
While parsing the list of data, the program will create student objects using the appropriate subclasses indicated by the degree program. 
Output is directed to the console.
